## Introduction
The current process of replacing lost or damaged ID cards at AASTU is often cumbersome and time-consuming for both students and administrative staff. Students face challenges such as long waiting times, complex documentation requirements, and lack of transparency in the process. As a result, there is a need to modernize and streamline the ID card replacement process to better serve the student community. The proposed ID Card Replacement (Appointment) System aims to address these challenges by providing a user-friendly, efficient, and transparent solution.

## Objectives
- Simplify the process of replacing lost or damaged ID cards for AASTU students.

- Enhance efficiency and transparency in the ID card replacement process.
- Improve the overall student experience by providing a user-friendly interface for requesting ID card replacements.

## Scope
The project will involve the design, development, and implementation of an ID Card Replacement (Appointment) System specifically tailored for AASTU students. The system will include user interfaces for students, the finance department, and the ID replacement department. It will facilitate document submission, request approval, appointment scheduling, and database management. The scope does not include physical production of ID cards or integration with external systems beyond the university's infrastructure.
